# chat_gpt_4

Basically what we have here is a very simply REPL type interface for interacting with the GPT-4 API I got access to.

It is hosted online [here](https://gpt4-chat-9f5ae.web.app/#/).  Note that this site is password protected since the API uses my secret key and I can't have that getting out for obvious reasons.  But check out the demo below!
